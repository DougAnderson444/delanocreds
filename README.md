# **Del**egatable **Ano**nymous **Cred**ential**s** (Delanocreds)

Create credentials, and delegate the ability to add more credentials, without revealing the identity of any of the holders in the delegation chain, including the prover.

Useful if you want the ability to delegate credentials, capabilities, or other data without revealing the identity of the delegation or holder(s).

Holders can also selectively prove attributes and remove the ability for delegatees to prove selected attributes.

## Delegation

What can be delegated is: the number of additional attribute Entries that can be added (zero to MaxEnties), but only if the credential is marked as _extendable_.

Even if there is no ability for a credential holder to add additional attributes, the follwoing is true:

-   Credentials holders can always assign their credential to a new public key
-   Attributes are always removable by a holder

It is important to note that the Credential can always be assigned to a new public key, that is what makes this scheme anonymizable.

Therefore, while holders may restrict the ability of delegatees to _add_ attributes, they will always be
able to assign the credential to a new public key for the attributes they _do_ have.

You may wish to apply a Credential Strategy such that the Credential is properly handled by the holder. This is left to the user, as the use cases of Credentials are varied too widely to provide a one-size-fits-all solution.

## Speed

This library can generate, issue, delegate, prove and verify 30 selected credentials out of 100 issued attributes in less than 400ms on [Intel i5-3470 CPU @ 3.20GHz](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Intel-Core-i5-3470/Rating/2771).

That's fast enough for time-critical applications like public transportation, ticketing, etc.

## Features

## Advantages

This scheme has the following advantages over other anonymous credential schemes:

-   **Attributes**: User can selectively disclose and prove some of the attributes in the credential.
-   **Expressiveness**: S (selective disclosure), R (arbitrary computable relations over attributes, meaning you can do more than just selective disclosure)
-   **Rest**: Means whether it is possible to apply a restriction on the delegator‚Äôs power during the delegation.
-   **Selective Anonymity**: Strong anonymity guarantees meaning that no one can trace or learn information about the user‚Äôs identity or anything beyond what they suppose to show during both the issuing/delegation and showing of credentials.
-   **Credential Size**: O(1), meaning the size of the credential is constant.
-   **Show Size**: O(L), meaning the size of the showing grows linearly in the number of delegations.
-   **Undisclosed attributes**: O(u), meaning the size of the undisclosed attributes grows linearly in the number of delegations.

üåì‚Ä† Requires a trusted setup and have a trapdoor associated to their parameters.

üåó‚ô£ It does not support an anonymous delegation phase.

üåô‚àó
It also allows an adversarial CA but no delegators‚Äôs keys leaks.

üåö‚Ä° We consider a malicious issuer key CA and all delegators keys can be exposed.

# Quick Bench

For eight (8) attributes, the following benchmarks were observed for each step:

| Step           | Time (ms) |
| -------------- | --------- |
| Setup          | 118       |
| Issue          | 168       |
| Offer          | 5         |
| Accept         | 83        |
| Prove          | 36        |
| Verify         | 124       |
| =============  | ========= |
| **Total Time** | **535**   |

Bench Variables:
l - upper bound for the length of the commitment vector
t - upper bound for the cardinality of the committed sets
n < t - number of attributes in each attribute set A_i in commitment C_i (same for each commitment level)
k - length of attribute set vector
k_prime - number of attributes sets which can be delegated

we set the above parameters as t = 25, l = 15, k = 4, k' = 7 and n = 10 to cover many different use-cases

Assumption:

-   each time a credential is delegated, an attribute is added
