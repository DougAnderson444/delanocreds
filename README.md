# **Del**egatable **Ano**nymous **Cred**ential**s** (Delanocreds)

Create messages that can be held by third parties, re-delegated, and verified without revealing the identity of any of the holders in the delegation chain.

Useful if you want the ability to delegate credntials, capabiltiies, or other data without revealing the identity of the delegation or holder(s).

You can also selectively delegate.

## Features

## Advantages

This scheme has the following advantages over other anonymous credential schemes:

-   **Attributes**: User can selectively disclose and prove some of the attributes in the credential.
-   **Expressiveness**: S (selective disclosure), R (arbitrary computable relations over attributes, meaning you can do more than just selective disclosure)
-   **Rest**: Means whether it is possible to apply a restriction on the delegator‚Äôs power during the delegation.
-   **Selective Anonymity**: Strong anonymity guarantees meaning that no one can trace or learn information about the user‚Äôs identity or anything beyond what they suppose to show during both the issuing/delegation and showing of credentials.
-   **Credential Size**: O(1), meaning the size of the credential is constant.
-   **Show Size**: O(L), meaning the size of the showing grows linearly in the number of delegations.
-   **Undisclosed attributes**: O(u), meaning the size of the undisclosed attributes grows linearly in the number of delegations.

üåì‚Ä† Requires a trusted setup and have a trapdoor associated to their parameters.

üåó‚ô£ It does not support an anonymous delegation phase.

üåô‚àó
It also allows an adversarial CA but no delegators‚Äôs keys leaks.

üåö‚Ä° We consider a malicious issuer key CA and all delegators keys can be exposed.
